# Android development
So, earlier this year my sister asked me to help her produce an Android app for tracking
her diabetic statistics and hospital related information. This would make it easier give
the doctor/nurse the information they need every time she's visiting them or maybe even
make it an automated system where she can send the information with a click in the app through email.

While I don't have that much time to put down into this I think it's a neat little sideproject for me to
refresh my knowledge about developing apps for Android. We had a course last year(?) about developing mobile apps
which went well, me and my project-partner made an app that could receive sales and deals from local restaurants. It
was similar to a coupon-checkbook that you would show the restaurant and get the specified deal. It was purely theoretical
and no restaurant was involved but we had some feedback from friends/family that worked in restaurants which thought it could
be a nice idea to increase sales and make local restaurants more attractive.

## Current stage
Right now I have a layout-image to go from and a base project in Android Studio where I've made the first page and
the side-menu. Most of it is from the basic template that you select when creating a new project but it looks alright.
The charts are from a third party module, I haven't looked too much into it but I only need it to show multiple lines
within a chart so as far as I can tell it'll work just fine.

Here's a gif of what it looks like right now.

I just found out it looks horrible in landscape-mode, whoops! Probably going to be lazy and restrict it to portrait-mode
so I don't have to deal with both layouts. :smile:

Icons are bound to change and the name of it isn't really "catchy". If we decide to put this up on Google Play there would
have to be some research into the marketing value of the name and icons. Right now I'm only making it for her personal use.

## When is it going to be finished?
I've promised that it'll be done by summer, even though it's just a simple input storage application I need to focus more
on my job as teacher assistant and researching my bachelor paper. The final projects from the course I'm working with are in
and will take most of this week to go through.

I look forward getting to know Android again, last time I worked with it alone I almost tore my hair off but with some background
in it I think it'll be an informative experience.

## Will it be published on Github?
No, since we haven't decided if we want it on Google Play I'd rather have it in a private repo on my homeserver than in a public repo.
I'll make some update posts on here about it which I will use as a sort of project diary incase I want to go back and look at the timeline
of the app.

On that end note I'm going to the barber to get a haircut, starting to get annoyed with the long hair and is well due for a close 8mm cut!
