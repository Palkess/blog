# Welcome!
The first post of the new blog. How exciting! This blog
will be used as an outlet for my thoughts and ideas. Most of it will
be about development in general, salty anger from playing fighting games
and everyday stuff.

### Why do I want to blog?
I feel like it will help me reflect on thoughts I have, getting them on "paper"
and letting me see if I can improve somewhere or change it in anyway. Letting other
people gain access to these thoughts might give me some feedback on why my thinking is
wrong/right/different.

### My blog
I looked around for different techniques on how I wanted to build the blog. Should I code
everything myself? Should I use Wordpress? Or something else?

I decided to go with Jekyll, which works well with github. I wanted to try something new and
I never really considered a static page-solution but for this purpose it seems like an okey
idea. I'll look into customizing everything when I get the time.

### What am I doing right now?
Drinking coffee. :coffee: :smile:

Right now I'm catching up on the studies I still have left so I can take my bachelors. I'm currently
studying Webdev. and working as a T.A at Blekinge Institute of Technology in Karlskrona. I've got a few
personal projects I'd like to work on but it's hard to find the time for it. The biggest right now is
probably the Android application I'm making for my sister. It wont be put up on github but I might release
it on Google Play Store if I feel it has enough quality. I'll dig deeper into what it is later on, still in
requirement-phase.

I might make these posts regularly, I might not. We'll see.

Over and out, captain!
